Verilog is a hardwware description language (HDL) standardized as IEEE 1364, it is useed to model and descript digital hardware (design and verification of digital circuits). Verilog is part of SystemVerilog Language, the more used version is Verilog 2001 (IEEE 1364-2001), but parts of Verilog 2005 are supported in many tools. Verilog is used too for verification of mixed-signal circuits analogic and digital. In 2009, the Verilog 2005 (IEEE 1364-2005) was merged into the SystemVerilog creating IEEE 1800-2009.
